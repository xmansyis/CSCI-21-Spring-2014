# be sure to use $(FLAGS) for all your assignments,
# and use the makefile to build your code before
# you turn it in. Your pc5 will not build with all
# the flags turned on. I think Boyd will allow me to
# warn you rather than giving you a zero for the
# assignment, but you'll want to fix it for future
# assignments. --Rob
